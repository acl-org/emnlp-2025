The EMNLP 2025 System Demonstration Program Committee invites proposals for the Demonstrations Program. Demonstrations may range from early research prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Publicly available open-source or open-access systems are of special interest. We additionally strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems that are technologically innovative given the current state of the art of theory and applied research in natural language processing.

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied natural language processing, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website.

Submitted systems may be of the following types:

* Natural language processing systems or system components  
* Application systems using language technology components  
* Software tools for natural language processing research  
* Software for demonstration or evaluation  
* Software supporting learning or education  
* Tools for data visualization and annotation  
* Tools for model inspection  
* Development tools  

Papers describing accepted demonstrations will be published in a companion volume of the EMNLP 2025 conference proceedings. We require at least one of the authors to present a live demo during a demo session at EMLP 2025, with an accompanying poster.  
**Please note:** Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must include the following:  

**A Paper**

A paper submitted to accompany a demonstration should outline the design of the system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to natural language processing. Technical details of the system are required, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). A paper can do this by addressing the following questions:

- What problem does the proposed system address?
- Why is the system important and what is its impact?
- What is the novelty in the approach/technology on which this system is based?
- Who is the target audience?
- How does the system work?
- How does it compare with existing systems?
- How is the system licensed?
- How was the system evaluated? Were user studies/human evaluation experiments conducted?

Note that this year, submissions that do not report any form of evaluation may be desk rejected.

Paper submission is electronic, using the OpenReview conference management system. Please submit your papers [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2025/System_Demonstrations).

Submissions can contain up to **6 pages** (longer submissions will be desk rejected), plus unlimited extra space for an optional ethics/broader impact statement and also unlimited space for references and informative appendices. Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content to incorporate reviewers’ comments.

Submissions must conform to the EMNLP 2025 official style guidelines and must be in PDF format. Submissions must describe original, unpublished work, as publication in EMNLP will be archival.  
Any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines and page limits will be desk rejected.

**A Demonstration Video**

A short (at most 2.5 minutes) screencast video demonstrating the system together with your paper submission. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won’t be published unless requested. If a screencast is not feasible, a video showcasing user interaction with the system may be used. Simple production is encouraged. Include the link in your paper (YouTube or similar), or submit the video as supplementary material in MPEG4 format.

**Live Demo Website or Installable Package**

A link to a live demo website or a downloadable installation package is required. Submissions without a link will be desk rejected unless justified (e.g., special hardware required).

## Multiple Submission Policy

We follow the Multiple Submission Policy of the EMNLP 2025 main conference. Submissions must not be under review or published elsewhere. Authors submitting multiple demo papers must ensure submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) in content or results.

## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing is **single-blind**. Authors should include names, affiliations, and may cite their own work.

## Ethics Policy

Authors must adhere to the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Research must consider the ethical implications of the system and data used. Extra space is allowed after the 6th page for discussion of broader impacts or ethical considerations. An ethical section is not required, but its absence in sensitive domains may lead to rejection. Papers flagged for ethical issues will be reviewed by the EMNLP ethics committee.
