<ul>
  <li>Early Registration: September 9–October 21</li>
  <li>Late Registration: October 22– November 11</li>
  <li>Onsite Registration: November 12–16</li>
</ul>

<p>The ACL &amp; EMNLP Exec have put together the following 3 registration types, each with an option for Authors to register their paper to present at the conference and cover their hard costs of presenting at the conference while allowing non-presenting authors and attendees a discounted rate for future advancement of the NLP Communities the ability to attend.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Industrial/Non-Academic</li>
  <li>Academic</li>
  <li>Student</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="authors-registration-fee-details">Authors Registration Fee Details</h2>

<p>Author Register Paper (for presentation) Industrial/Non-Academic, Academic or Student</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper to an ACL conference (ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or EMNLP) must register their paper to present at the conference. 
Exceptions to the statement above:
Accepted Finding that are not being presented. All findings being presented must register their paper.
Workshop shared tasked papers do not need to register their paper to present.</p>

<h3 id="note-all-paper-registration-fees-are-based-on-actual-hard-cost-to-the-conference">Note all Paper registration fees are based on actual hard cost to the conference</h3>
<p>In person registration fee reflects the attendees’ hard costs of food &amp; beverage (breaks, welcome reception and social dinner) along with meeting space, av or poster presentation equipment). 
Virtual attendees’ registration fees reflect the virtual costs (internet, AV, content management, platforms).</p>

<h3 id="author-deadlines-for-registering-the-paper-to-present">Author Deadlines for Registering the Paper to Present</h3>
<p>To assist the program chairs and committee with publishing the conference details for the program and Anthology we ask all authors to register no later than the following dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Accepted – Main Conference, Findings, CL/TACL, DEMOS &amp; Industry – October 14th</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepted – Workshop no later than the Early Registration deadline of October 21st</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All Authors presenting their paper at a workshop must have 1 author register your paper. If attending the full conference, select the Registered Paper option and follow the prompts  to select  your attendee type.
<em>Workshop Exception for registering your paper would be shared task papers. Shared Tasks are not required to register your paper.</em>
Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a registration once you receive notification.</p>

<p>Paper registration instructions, policy and fees are below the conference rates listed after membership and cancelation policies.</p>

<h2 id="membership-policy">Membership Policy</h2>
<p>The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2024) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Industrial, Non-Academic, Academic attendee will add a $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add a $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2024 paid member.
Your ACL membership is for the entire 2024 year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again.
Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.</p>

<h2 id="cancellation-policy">Cancellation Policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (October 14th, 2024, or before), will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee).</li>
  <li>Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (October 21st, 2024) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.</li>
  <li>Cancellations 2 weeks prior to the start of the conference (Oct 28th, 2024), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually.</li>
