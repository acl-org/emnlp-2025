The EMNLP 2025 Awards were announced during the Award Ceremony; this page lists the paper awards, SAC highlights, and the outstanding reviewers and chairs recognized by the program. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Best Paper

* **Infini-gram mini: Exact n-gram Search at the Internet Scale with FM-Index**  
  _Hao Xu, Jiacheng Liu, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi_

  The committee praised this work as a strong “crossover” contribution that brings a well-established technique from another community to NLP, and as foundational for a more systematic “physics of language models”.
