**Conference Dates:** November 5–9, 2025  
**Registration link coming soon**

We offer early and late rates to encourage early registrations. This helps us estimate the number of onsite and virtual attendees for planning space, food, beverage, supplies and to avoid system crashes and other glitches from unexpectedly high volume with last minute registrations. ￼

**Early Registration:** Ends October 6, 2025 AOE

**Late Registration:** Ends for In-Person and Virtual: November 3, 2025 23:59 (GMT +8)

**On-site Registration:** Will open for In-Person and Virtual on November 4 - 9. See onsite registration times (GMT +8)

## Registration Tiers

The ACL Executive Committee has established three registration tiers, each with an additional fee option for authors presenting papers. These fees cover the direct costs of presentation while keeping attendance more affordable for non-presenting authors and participants.

- **Industry Pricing** – For-profit organizations; highest tier; helps subsidize other categories.
- **Academic / Regular Pricing** – Universities and research institutions; standard tier for non-students.
- **Student Pricing** – Discounted tier for enrolled students; requires proof of status.
