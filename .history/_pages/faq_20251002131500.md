**Can you share more information about the final decision process?**

While we spent a considerable amount of time going over outliers cases (e.g. where the difference of avg. reviewer score to the AC score was large), ultimately, we had to rely on the multiple layers of the review process and usually deferred to the judgement of the SACs who had access to a much larger pool of papers and reviews than individual reviewers and ACs. The SACs were hand-picked for papers in specific tracks both because of their experience with the review process, as well as their publication record in our field and in the relevant area. We do not take it upon ourselves to second-guess all of the work the SACs do.  We may not fully agree, but we only overturn in cases that diverge substantially from expected levels variation across levels in the process.

**Can I make changes to the list of authors for the camera-ready submission?**

Yes, you can edit the list on the camera-ready form, but make sure you read and comply with the guidance in the [ACL Authorship Changes Policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/Authorship_Changes_Policy_for_ACL_Conference_Papers) (section 4).

**Can I change the title?**

You can apply for funding and other types of assistance through the Diversity and Inclusion call. You can also be considered for a complimentary registration if you become a [student volunteer](https://2025.emnlp.org/calls/volunteers/).

**What if I register for in-person attendance but cannot get a Visa?**

You will be able to switch to a virtual attendance and get a refund of the price difference between the in-person and virtual rates. Alternatively, you can cancel up to 4 weeks in advance and get a full refund (minus the processing fees).
