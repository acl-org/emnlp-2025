Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration is intended to make ACL events accessible to researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your

- country of residence,
- employment position,
- monthly income range,
- available financial support from your employer/university, and
- special circumstances.

Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.

**Note 1:** The virtual registration subsidies are only available for participants who are NOT registering any paper. If you are registering a paper and need financial assistance, please apply for the D&I subsidies and/or volunteering opportunities instead.

**Note 2:** If you are applying for virtual registration subsidies, you SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your subsidy application.

## Instructions

Applicants should fill out the Virtual Registration Subsidies Application form before September 24, 2025, 23:59 (AoE). Please read the information carefully to help you fill in the form.

- Application Deadline: September 24, 2025, 23:59 (AoE)
