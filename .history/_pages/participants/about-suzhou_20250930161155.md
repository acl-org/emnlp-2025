Suzhou is a historical and cultural city in Jiangsu Province, China, located in the Yangtze River Delta, about 100 kilometers from Shanghai. With over 2,500 years of history, Suzhou is known as the "Venice of the East" for its classical gardens, water town characteristics, and silk culture. It is recognized by UNESCO as a "World Heritage City," with nine classical gardens listed as World Cultural Heritage sites.
Suzhou not only preserves rich traditional culture but is also one of China's most economically active cities, home to numerous high-tech enterprises and industrial parks. The Jinji Lake area represents Suzhou's modern urban landscape, while Pingjiang Road and Shantang Street showcase the traditional water town charm of Suzhou.
