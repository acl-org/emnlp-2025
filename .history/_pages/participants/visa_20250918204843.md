Thank you for your interest in attending EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou China. Weâ€™re excited to welcome you.

There are several visa options for attendees:

- Visa-free entry: Several countries allow short-term entry to China without a visa.
- Transit visa: Travelers passing through China en route to a third country may be eligible.
- Tourist visa (L): This category is available to applicants from all countries.
- 
Please check this [quick reference sheet to see which you qualify for, along with the required documents to apply.

We are aware of the delay in responses to visa requests and are actively working to find a viable solution to the visa invitation letter issue.
Due to current Chinese regulations, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is not recognized as a Chinese entity. As a result, invitation letters issued by ACL cannot be guaranteed for use in F-category (business/academic) visa applications. We understand this may cause inconvenience and sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to engage with the relevant authorities.

We therefore strongly recommend that you first explore visa-free entry, transit visas, or a tourist (L) visa before considering an F visa. 

If you have further questions about your visa options, please consult your nearest Chinese embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date guidance.
