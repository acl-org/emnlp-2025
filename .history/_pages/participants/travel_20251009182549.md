All travel mileage and duration listed below are to the [Suzhou International Expo Centre (SuzhouExpo)](https://en.suzhouexpo.com/zhanguansheshiEn-335.html).

## From Airport/Train Station to Venue
### From [Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG)](https://www.shanghaiairport.com/index_en.html)
1. **Airport Bus (Direct Option)**: The airport long-distance bus runs directly from Pudong Airport to Suzhou. The trip usually takes about 2.5 to 3 hours and costs around 120 RMB. This is the most straightforward way if you arrive during the day and want to avoid multiple transfers. However, the number of departures per day is limited, and the last bus typically leaves around 8:00 p.m. If you arrive later, you may need to consider another option. After arriving in Suzhou (usually at Suzhou North or the main Suzhou Railway Station), you can take a short taxi or metro ride to Novotel Suzhou SIP.
2. **Metro / Airport Link + High-Speed Train**: You can take the Airport Link Line or Metro Line 2 from Pudong Airport to Hongqiao Railway Station, and then board a high-speed train to Suzhou. High-speed trains between Shanghai Hongqiao and Suzhou run every 10–15 minutes throughout the day, and the ride takes only 25 minutes. The total journey (including transfers) takes about 3–4 hours. This route offers great flexibility since train tickets are easy to buy on-site and there are many departures.
3. **Private Transfer or Taxi**: A private car or long-distance taxi from Pudong Airport to Suzhou is the most convenient but also the most expensive choice. The trip takes 3.5–5 hours depending on traffic and costs approximately 800–1000 RMB. This option is recommended only if you arrive very late or carry a lot of luggage.

* Practical Information:
  1. **Should I buy tickets in advance or on-site?** For the metro and high-speed train, it is perfectly fine to buy tickets on-site, especially on weekdays. Trains run frequently and rarely sell out except during national holidays or weekends. You can purchase tickets directly at the railway station using your passport.
  2. **How to pay on-site? Are European bank cards accepted?**
Most metro and train station service counters in Shanghai now accept international credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).
However, not all ticket machines accept foreign cards, so if your card does not work at a machine, you can go to the staffed counter.
It is also advisable to carry a small amount of Chinese cash (RMB) as a backup in case of technical issues.
You can withdraw RMB from ATMs at Pudong Airport using major international debit or credit cards.
1) What happens if I buy in advance but miss the train or bus?
If you miss a metro or airport link train, you can simply board the next one.
For high-speed trains, you can usually exchange your ticket for the next available train at the station ticket office (a small change fee may apply).
For airport buses, tickets are valid only for the specific departure, so if you miss your bus, you will need to buy a new ticket for the next one.
